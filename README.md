Cellshape-cluster is an easy-to-use tool to analyse the cluster cells by their shape using deep learning and, in particular, deep-embedded-clustering. The tool provides the ability to train popular graph-based or convolutional autoencoders on point cloud or voxel data of 3D single cell masks as well as providing pre-trained networks for inference.
